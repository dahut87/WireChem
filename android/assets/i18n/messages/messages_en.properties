[positiver-name]=Non-activable positiver 
[positiver-desc]=Charge an elektron positivly when it goes across this transmuter, neverless it's nature. This is non-activable version of the transmuter.
[positiveri-name]=Positiver I
[positiveri-desc]=Charge an elektron positivly when it goes across this transmuter, neverless it's nature. This is initial version of the transmuter.
[positiverii-name]=Positiver II
[positiverii-desc]=Charge an elektron positivly when it goes across this transmuter, neverless it's nature. This is the first evolution of the transmuter, easier to put on grid with less temperature at use.
[positiveriii-name]=Positiver III
[positiveriii-desc]=Charge an elektron positivly when it goes across this transmuter, neverless it's nature. This is the second evolution of the transmuter which take only one cell.
[negativer-name]=Non-activable negativer 
[negativer-desc]=Charge an elektron negativly when it goes across this transmuter, neverless it's nature. This is non-activable version of the transmuter.
[negativeri-name]=Negativer I
[negativeri-desc]=Charge an elektron negativly when it goes across this transmuter, neverless it's nature. This is initial version of the transmuter.
[negativerii-name]=Negativer II
[negativerii-desc]=Charge an elektron negativly when it goes across this transmuter, neverless it's nature. This is the first evolution of the transmuter, easier to put on grid with less temperature at use.
[negativeriii-name]=Negativer III
[negativeriii-desc]=Charge an elektron negativly when it goes across this transmuter, neverless it's nature. This is the second evolution of the transmuter which take only one cell.
[inverteri-name]=Inverter I
[inverteri-desc]=Invert the charge of an elektron when it goes across this transmuter, neverless it's nature. This is initial version of the transmuter.
[inverterii-name]=Inverter II
[inverterii-desc]=Invert the charge of an elektron when it goes across this transmuter, neverless it's nature. This is the first evolution of the transmuter.
[neutraliseri-name]=Neutraliser I
[neutraliseri-desc]=Nullify the charge of an elektron when it goes across this transmuter, neverless it's nature. This is initial version of the transmuter.
[neutraliserii-name]=Neutraliser II
[neutraliserii-desc]=Nullify the charge of an elektron when it goes across this transmuter, neverless it's nature. This is the first evolution of the transmuter.
[insufler33-name]=Insufler 33%
[insufler33-desc]=Change direction of 33%, one on three of the elektron neverless it's nature to the first exit.
[insufler50-name]=Insufler 50%
[insufler50-desc]=Change direction of 50%, one on two of the elektron neverless it's nature to the first exit.
[insufler100-name]=Insufler 100%
[insufler100-desc]=Change direction of 100%, every elektron neverless it's nature  to the first exit.
[oneway-name]=Oneway
[oneway-desc]=Let elekrons going accross this transmuter only in one direction, the others are blocked and go to the opposite.
[distributer-name]=Distributer
[distributer-desc]=Change direction every elektron respectively to exit 1,2 and 3, this allow to distribute one on three elektron on each exit.
